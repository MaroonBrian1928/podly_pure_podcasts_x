class MultiProcessRotatingFileHandler(RotatingFileHandler):
    """A ``RotatingFileHandler`` that is safe when several processes share a file.

    Podly writes ``app.log`` from more than one process: the writer service
    (``python3 -m app.writer``), the Flask app (``src/main.py``), and each
    per-job ``processing_worker`` subprocess. With the stock handler each of
    them rotates independently -- one process renames ``app.log`` to
    ``app.log.1`` while the others keep writing to the inode they already hold
    open. The result is that "the current log" silently becomes whichever
    backup a given process happens to be holding, and a reader tailing
    ``app.log`` sees only a fraction of the output.

    Two changes make that safe:

    - Rotation is serialised across processes with an ``flock``-ed sidecar
      lock file, so only one process rolls the numbered backups at a time.
    - Under that lock the handler re-checks whether the file it holds open is
      still the one at ``baseFilename``. If another process rotated first,
      this process simply drops its stale stream and reopens instead of
      rotating a second time.

    The staleness check runs before every emit. It costs two ``stat`` calls per
    record, which is small next to the JSON extras encoding and secret
    redaction this logger's formatter already does, and it is what keeps a
    process from writing a further ``maxBytes`` of records into a file that
    was rotated away -- the exact symptom that made ``app.log`` stop being the
    current log for hours at a time.

    Requires POSIX ``flock``, which is what podly runs on everywhere.
